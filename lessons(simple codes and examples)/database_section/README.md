Basics work(Selecting, Inserting, Deleting, and Updating) with sqlite(script1.py) and postgresql(script2.py)
- when working with SQLite(script1.py) we creating lite.db database where store all data
- when working with PostreSQL(script2.py) we creating local database('silverdb') with owner('silver') and password('123'). All othe configuration stay the default.
For working with script2.py you need create local database with help PostGreSQL(if you don't have PosrGreSQL in you computer dawloud it from here 
https://www.postgresql.org/download/" and install.
